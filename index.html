I am Ashu and this is my story it started in my second semester in Jaipur. Before the second semester, I need to do my summer training at a company in Jaipur. In this company, I meet Jyoti. She is a very simple and sweet girl. She is starting a job with her B.C.A degree. I am the first trainer of her.
She looks like a normal girl. I am not even giving much attention to her. But in the 15-day training program. I know her better and now I think she is not that normal that much I think.

After 5 to 8 days I pretty much know about her like her family, her little brother, her mother, and her father. After that, I send a friend request on Facebook and we start talking on message. 
When my training is completed. she will switch the company. After 15 days my college started and I am regularly going to college and when I have time then we chat. Then I learned some more about her as they belong to Bihar but her father and mother moved to Jaipur and she has been living in Jaipur for many years. We will regularly chat with each other next 2 semesters. During this time I felt attached to her. 
In 4th semester covid 19 starts and college will close till the next announcement. I come home and the next 5th and 6th semester we talk a lot. In the 7th semester, I am going to Delhi and Banglore for my cyber security training, and over frequency of chat has been downgraded now we talk very little in a week or once in two weeks. One a guy is calling me and asking about her


The person I may know, because we've talked about him many times, but I'm talking to him for the first time, and he asked me some weird questions. After speaking with him, I spoke with her, and she was crying during the call. The man is saying that she likes you. We start chatting further.</span>
